                My name is Dylan Fitzpatrick. I am 21 years old and am currently in my 3rd year of my undergraduate Computer
                Science Degree at Trinity College Dublin. I will join<a href="https://www.irlca.com" target="_blank" class="IRLCA"> IRLCA </a>as a Software Devloper Intern this summer between my 3rd and
                4th years of study. I am very ambitious. hard-working and eager to enter the workforce. Most of my programming
                experience is in Java, I also have experience in a variety of programming languages such as C, R, Haskell,
                Prolog, Javascript, Python as well as HTML and CSS.

                A project as part of the 3rd year in my Computer Science degree. This project was a collaboration of a team of 
                3rd and 2nd year students, totaling 10 members. I took on a managerial position in this project. The goal of this project is to use Clang
                APIs to detect common antipatterns within a C++ codebase such as deadlocking etc.

                This was a group project comprised of 6 members including myself. This project allows a user to upload an image
                to a website in order to rate an image based on various
                metrics which our team chose. The metrics used were: brisque score, tags, trend search i.e. the image's
                relevance, reverse image search to show how many similar images exist and the type of the image e.g. clip art,
                photograph etc. The backend was written using ReactJS. My main contribution to the project was the reverse image
                search metric.
