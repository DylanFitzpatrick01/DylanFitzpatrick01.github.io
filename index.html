    <span class="description">
        My name is Dylan Fitzpatrick. I am 21 years old and am currently in my 3rd year of my undergraduate Computer
        Science Degree at Trinity College Dublin. I am currently looking for a summer internship between my 3rd and
        4th years of study. I am very ambitious, hard-working and eager to enter the workforce. Most of my programming
        experience is in Java, I also have experience in a variety of programming languages such as C, R, Haskell,
        Prolog, Javascript, Python as well as HTML and CSS. I am currently looking for a summer internship in software
        engineering.

    <h3>Shutterstock Image Rating Project</h3>
</a>
<div class="shutterstock-project">
    <p>
        This was a group project comprised of 6 members including myself. This project allows a user to upload an image to a website in order to rate an image based on various
        metrics which our team chose. The metrics used were: brisque score, tags, trend search i.e. the image's
        relevance, reverse image search to show how many similar images exist and the type of the image e.g. clip art,
        photograph etc. The backend was written using ReactJS. My main contribution to the project was the reverse image
        search metric.

<div class="github-statistics">
    <p>
        A web based project which takes data from Microsoft's open source calculator. Shows the user various graphs
        displaying
        contributors statistic e.g. most issues opened/closed. Also allows the user to search for a specific
        contributor.
        My contribution to this project was implementing a MySQL database to store the data in a table.

<div class="bus-management-system">
    <p>
        A Java based program which implements Dijkstra's algorithm. This program allows to user to find the shortest
        route
        between two bus stops, search stop details by the stop's name and search for a stop based on the arrival time.
        The
        data is taken from 3 .txt files.
