                    My name is Dylan Fitzpatrick. I am 21 years old and am currently in my 3rd year of my undergraduate Computer
                    Science Degree at Trinity College Dublin. I will join<a href="https://www.irlca.com" target="_blank" class="IRLCA"> IRLCA </a>
                    as a Software Devloper Intern this summer between my 3rd and
                    4th years of study. I am very ambitious, hard-working and eager to enter the workforce. Most of my programming
                    experience is in Java, I also have experience in a variety of programming languages such as C, R, Haskell,
                    Prolog, Javascript, Python as well as HTML and CSS.

                    I spent my 6 years of secondary education attending Me&aacute;nscoil Iogn&aacute;id R&iacute;s, otherwise known
                    as Naas CBS, in Naas, County Kildare. The subjects I studied as part of my Leaving Certificate were: Mathematics,
                    English, Irish, German, Physics, Chemistry and Economics, all studied at Higher Level. I graduated in 2020, achieving 566 points in my Leaving
                    Certificate exams.

                    I am currently in my third year of the Integrated Computer Science degree at Trinity College Dublin. I am a
                    member of the Dublin University Computer Science Society (DUCSS). I completed both my first and second year of
                    study with First Class Honours (I.I) and aim to achieve the same this year.
                    Modules of interest studied are:

                        A project as part of the Software Engineering Project II module in the 3rd year of my Computer Science degree. 
                        This project was a collaboration of a team of 3rd and 2nd year students, totaling 10 members. I took on a 
                        managerial position in this project. The goal of this project is to use Clang APIs in Python to detect common 
                        antipatterns within a C++ codebase such as deadlocking etc. and give the user warnings/errors based on the 
                        antipattern(s) found.

                        A project as part of the module Software Engineering Project I in the 2nd year of my degree. This was a group project 
                        comprised of 6 members including myself. This project allows a user to upload an image to a website in order to rate 
                        an image based on various metrics which our team chose, using NextJS and NodeJS. The metrics used were: brisque score, 
                        tags, trend search i.e. the image's relevance, reverse image search to show how many similar images exist and the type 
                        of the image e.g. clip art, photograph etc. The backend was written using ReactJS. My main contribution to the project 
                        was implementing the reverse image search metric.

                        displaying contributors statistic e.g. most issues opened/closed. Also allows the user to search for a specific
                        contributor. My contribution to this project was implementing a MySQL database to store the data.

                    route between two bus stops, search stop details by the stop's name and search for a stop based on the arrival time.
                    The data is taken from 3 .txt files.
