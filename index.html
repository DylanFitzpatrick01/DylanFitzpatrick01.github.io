                    My name is Dylan Fitzpatrick. I am 22 years old and I am in my 4th year studying Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin.
                    I have experience with Java, C#, Python and am very familiar with agile methodologies.

                    IRLCA ~ Software Developer Intern ~ June 2023 - August 2023

                <p>
                    I had an internship at IRLCA Limited between June - August 2023. This role provided me an excellent opportunity to utilise my skills within a work environment
                    as well as providing me the chance to learn many new, useful things. In this role I used C#, Entity Framework Core and Fluent API to build an application backend, implementing CRUD operations
                    and manipulating an SQL database with them. I also learned a lot about Domain-Driven Design and used it in practice. This internship used agile methodology, with daily stand-ups and 2 week 
                    long sprints.

                    as Naas CBS, in Naas, County Kildare. The subjects I studied as part of my Leaving Certificate were: Mathematics,
                    English, Irish, German, Physics, Chemistry and Economics, all studied at Higher Level. I graduated in 2020, achieving 566 points in my Leaving
                    Certificate exams.

                        This project was a collaboration of a team of 3rd and 2nd year students, totaling 10 members. I took on a 
                        managerial position in this project. The goal of this project is to use Clang APIs in Python to detect common 
                        antipatterns within a C++ codebase such as deadlocking etc. and give the user warnings/errors based on the 
                        antipattern(s) found.

                        A project as part of the module Software Engineering Project I in the 2nd year of my degree. This was a group project 
                        comprised of 6 members including myself. This project allows a user to upload an image to a website in order to rate 
                        an image based on various metrics which our team chose, using NextJS and NodeJS. The metrics used were: brisque score, 
                        tags, trend search i.e. the image's relevance, reverse image search to show how many similar images exist and the type 
                        of the image e.g. clip art, photograph etc. The backend was written using ReactJS. My main contribution to the project 
                        was implementing the reverse image search metric.

                        clients to retrieve files from one or more workers based on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. This is done through the use of an 
                        ingress node which communicates with both the client and worker nodes.

                        The second assignment in my Computer Networks module in 3rd year. The aim of this assignment was to implement forward flows of packets. 
                        Communication is achieved between an ”employee” and a ”deployment server” by including the destination address in the packet header. 
                        The packet is then sent sent through a series of ”forwarders” which consult a ”controller” to determine where the next hop is. I put my
                        own personal twist on it by allowing the user to request an appointment time and would be returned whether or not that appointment is 
                        available.
